# Basic Data Types
We’ll start off with the three basic data types in Python — ints, floats, and strings.


## Ints
An int (short for integer) is simply any whole number.

**Examples**
* 22
* 0
* -11

## Floats
A float (short for floating point number) is the decimal representation of a number.

**Examples**
* 0.7777
* 2.0
* -3.4342342

Python can do many interesting things with ints and floats. Open up your terminal and type `python` (`python3` if using Mac OS X or Linux). From there, you will see your Python version number and you will be able to enter text. Let’s code!

First, type in `11 + 7` and hit enter. You’ll see that the Python interpreter has replied with 18, which is the result of adding the two numbers together.

### Try out the following examples!
1. What will happen if you do
    1. `8 % 2`
    2. `8 % 7`
    3. `17 / 2`
    4. `17 // 2`
    5. `17 * 2`
    6. 
2. Replace the `?` with the relevant operator to make the equations correct
    1. `9 ? 4 = 1`
    2. `9 `
