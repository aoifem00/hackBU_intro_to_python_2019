#for your program to be useful in a variety of situations it needs the ability to respond to user input
#we do this with the line

x = input("please type ")

#the message in parenthesis will be displayed to the user and the data they enter will be saved to x
#input can be called for at any time
#write a function that accepts user input and a variable of your chosing 
#then prints a result based on the interraction between the two
