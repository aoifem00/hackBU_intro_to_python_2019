# Input
For your program to be useful in a variety of situations it needs the ability to respond to user input.
We do this with the line

'''
x = input("please type ")
'''

The message in parenthesis will be displayed to the user and the data they enter will be saved to x.
Input can be called for at any time in your program.

### Write a function that accepts user input and a variable, then prints a result.
